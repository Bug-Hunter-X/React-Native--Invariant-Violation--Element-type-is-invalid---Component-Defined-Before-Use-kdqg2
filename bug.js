This error occurs when you try to use a component before it has been defined or imported correctly.  It's common when working with asynchronous imports or dynamic component loading.  For example, if you're using a component from a library that hasn't fully loaded, or if you're importing a component in the wrong order, you might encounter this issue.  React Native will throw an error such as `Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid` or a similar message, often pointing to an undefined component.
